Infer Schema
Pros:
1. Its easy to use and helpful when the schema is unknown.
2. No need dto manually specify the schema and so code is less

Cons:
1. Performance Overhead - Spark needs to scan the entire resultset to infer schema and that might impact performance
2. Data quality issues -  Inference may lead to incorrect schema definitions if the data has incorrect values
3. Type Inference: Inferencing may not always correctly identify the data types of columns, leading to potential data type mismatches.

Define Schema
Pros
1. Performance: Defining the schema explicitly can significantly improve performance because Spark doesnâ€™t need to scan the entire dataset to infer the schema.
2. Data Quality: You have control over the schema definition, ensuring that it accurately represents your data. This is important for data integrity and consistency.

Cons
1. More Code: You need to write additional code to define the schema, which can be more cumbersome, especially for complex datasets or when the schema evolves over time.
